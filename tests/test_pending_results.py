"""A background job's answer must outlive the connection meant to carry it.

The completion is sent over the very socket the request arrived on. If that
socket is gone by the time the work finishes, the send fails and the answer is
lost -- the work done, the result built, nobody listening. Three users reported
that shape of loss in a single day, and 98 job records fleet-wide were sitting
at "running" with nothing ever coming back.

So the event is written down before the send and replayed on the next
connection. These tests drive the real module, not a copy of its logic.
