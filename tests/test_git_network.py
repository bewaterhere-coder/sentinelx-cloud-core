"""git operations that touch the network.

WHY THESE EXIST AT ALL. Measured over 7 days, distinct users reaching for git
through exec: fetch 489, push 399, ls-remote 374, clone 359. The work is already
happening; it just happens as free-form command lines the model assembles, where
nothing can check what it assembled.

WHY THERE IS NO `pull`. It is fetch plus merge, and a merge can conflict, leave
a dirty tree, or move HEAD somewhere the caller did not intend. One verb that
sounds atomic hiding all of that is worse than two that are honest.

THE POINT OF push. 189 users force-pushed through exec without a lease against
56 who used one. A bare force silently discards whatever someone else pushed in
between, and an assistant cannot notice. Here a force MUST carry the SHA it
expects to replace, which turns it into a compare-and-swap.
