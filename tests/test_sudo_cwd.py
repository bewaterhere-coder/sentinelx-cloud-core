"""With sudo, the directory change must happen after privileges are granted.

Passing cwd= to create_subprocess_exec makes the PARENT chdir before exec, as
the agent's own user. So asking for sudo=true on a root-owned directory failed
with PermissionError before sudo ran at all -- the one case where the
privileges were requested precisely because the directory needs them. Reported
against an 0700 worktree the agent user cannot enter.
