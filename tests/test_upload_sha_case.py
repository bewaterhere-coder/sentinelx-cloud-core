"""A correct SHA-256 in uppercase is a correct SHA-256.

hexdigest() is always lowercase, and the completion compared the caller's value
against it as a plain string. So a digest right in every way except letter case
was rejected as checksum_mismatch -- a message saying the bytes arrived wrong
when they arrived perfectly. Uppercase is the convention in many manifests.

Reported with a three-chunk reproduction of b"abcdefghi" and a lowercase control
of the identical payload that succeeded. Both are reproduced here THROUGH THE
REAL HANDLERS: an earlier version of this file reimplemented the comparison in
the test and therefore passed with the fix deleted.
