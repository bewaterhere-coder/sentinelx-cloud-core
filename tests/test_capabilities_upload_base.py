"""capabilities reports where uploads actually land.

The agent resolves its staging directory at start-up: from the config, or the
first writable candidate (/var/lib/sentinelx/uploads, then the legacy
/home/sentinelx/uploads), or the system temp space. Nothing exposed which one
won, so anything host-side that resolves a bare filename had to hard-code our
path -- and broke silently when it guessed wrong. One operator reported it
after writing to three different directories trying to find the right one;
another asked for exactly this on the same day.
