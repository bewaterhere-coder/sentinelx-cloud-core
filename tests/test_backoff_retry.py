"""Reconnect timing: a gentler curve, jitter, and a hub-supplied hint.

Three problems, one place. The curve jumped 5 -> 30 seconds, so a momentary
break on a healthy path cost close to a minute offline. Every agent waited the
identical delay, so a hub restart brought ~1700 of them back in one spike. And
the hub, which is the only party that knows how many are reconnecting at once,
had no way to say so.
