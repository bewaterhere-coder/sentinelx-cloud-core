"""Deleting SentinelX's OWN backup is terminal -- no backup of a backup.

delete normally refuses to destroy without a recovery copy. That guarantee turns
against the user for .bak artifacts: backing up a backup just makes another .bak,
so space can never be reclaimed (a real feature request -- 5.2 GB of stranded
backups). For our own backup pattern only, delete skips the copy and removes it
directly. The risk to guard is over-matching: a user's own file that merely
contains ".bak" must NOT be treated as ours and must keep its mandatory backup.
