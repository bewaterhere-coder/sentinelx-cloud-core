"""Every advertised protocol feature must be one the agent can actually receive.

Executor.PROTOCOL_FEATURES goes out in the hello, and the hub sends a field only
to an agent that asked for it. RequestMessage is extra="forbid", so advertising
a field the pinned protocol does not define is worse than not advertising it:
the hub starts sending it and the agent rejects the WHOLE message, dropping the
operation rather than ignoring the extra.

That is exactly what a clean install of core 0.15.0 did. It advertised
opaque_ref while pyproject pinned protocol v1.11.0, where RequestMessage has no
such field, so every tagged request died with extra_forbidden before dispatch.
Found by FalconZip, who installed from the declared dependency rather than from
a working tree that happened to have a newer protocol sitting in it -- which is
why none of us saw it.

This test compares the advertisement against the INSTALLED protocol, so it fails
in the same environment a user would get.
