"""help must not point an operator at operations this host has switched off.

On a deny-all host -- disabled_ops covering read/list/edit/exec/service, no
file_ops paths, no playbooks -- help(topic='operations') listed every op anyway,
and help(topic='access') recommended op:edit, op:service and playbooks that do
not exist here. It guided the operator straight into locked doors. Reported on a
Windows host where only ping/help/capabilities were live.

navigation now shows only live ops, and extending_access says plainly when the
host cannot edit its own config remotely.
