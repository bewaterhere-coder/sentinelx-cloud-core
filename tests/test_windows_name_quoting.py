"""Service and task names are quoted before they reach a command line.

They are operator-chosen and interpolated straight into PowerShell and cmd.
Unquoted, a name with a space splits into two arguments: `schtasks /End /TN My
Task` addresses "My" and passes "Task" as a stray argument. On the Windows
self-restart that matters more than usual, because the sequence is kill, end,
start -- the kill half always works and the start half is the one that
silently addresses nothing, leaving the agent down with nothing left to bring
it back. The operator loses remote access to the host precisely because the
tool they manage it with is what died.

The default install uses "SentinelX", which has no space, so this never showed
up in our own testing.
