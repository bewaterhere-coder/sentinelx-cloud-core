"""capabilities must evidence the operator's decisions, not only their effect.

ops_supported is the permitted set: a disabled op is simply not in it. But that
alone cannot tell an auditor WHY something is absent -- an old agent that never
had the op and a current one where it was deliberately turned off look
identical from outside. Requested by an operator running a governance audit who
needed to evidence the difference rather than infer it.
