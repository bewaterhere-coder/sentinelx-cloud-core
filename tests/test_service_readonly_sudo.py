"""Reading a service's state must not ask for privileges it does not need.

requires_sudo is a property of the SERVICE, and operators set it because
restarting needs root. That then dragged sudo onto plain status reads too. On a
host installed with NoNewPrivileges -- our own hardened default -- sudo cannot
run at all, so asking whether a service was up failed on exactly the hosts that
had followed our security advice.

Measured on a real host as the agent's unprivileged user: status, is-active and
is-enabled return 0; restart and stop fail with "Interactive authentication
required". The split below follows that measurement, not an assumption.
