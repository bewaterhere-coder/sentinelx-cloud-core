"""An operator can switch an op off, and it disappears rather than refusing.

allowed_commands gates `exec` and only `exec` -- that is what its own heading
says. script_run runs a script body through an interpreter and was never bound
by it. Reasonable operators read an empty allowlist as "this host executes
nothing" and were surprised; two reported it independently, one after a
governance audit on a Windows host where the service runs as LocalSystem. Being
documented did not make the surprise unreasonable, and there was no supported
way to say no.

Removal from the registry rather than a guard inside each handler is the whole
design: capabilities derives ops_supported from those keys and dispatch answers
unsupported_op for anything absent, so one deletion makes an op both invisible
and unreachable. These tests hold that property.
