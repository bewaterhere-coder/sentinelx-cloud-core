"""An unusable cwd is named, not surfaced as internal_error.

Without sudo, the parent process chdirs into `cwd` as the agent's own user
before the script exists. A directory that user cannot enter raised a bare
PermissionError, reported as "internal_error: [Errno 13]" -- which reads like an
agent defect. Reported by an operator who had declared the path rw in policy and
could not see why it failed; rw in file_ops does not grant Unix access, and the
error now says so.

The sudo=true variant of the same report was already fixed in 0.12.2 (the
chdir happens after elevation). These tests pin the no-sudo side.
