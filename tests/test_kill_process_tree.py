"""A timed-out script must not leave its descendants running.

_kill_process_tree killed only the process we spawned. On Windows the tree was
already covered; on POSIX it was not, so a timed-out `docker run` left the
docker client and its root-owned wrapper alive for hours, one pair per
attempt, until the host was cleaned by hand.

Two details here were settled by experiment, not reasoning, and both are easy
to get wrong again:

- `kill -9 -<pgid>` is parsed as an option, not a process group. It exits 0
  and kills nothing. The `--` separator is what makes it a group.
- A tree started under sudo is root-owned and the agent user cannot signal it;
  killpg raises PermissionError and everything survives.
