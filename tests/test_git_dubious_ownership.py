"""A checkout owned by another user is not "not a git repository".

Git refuses to read a repository owned by a different user than the process
running it, and exits non-zero -- the same rc as "there is no repo here". We
read only the rc, so both became not_a_git_repo, whose text then tells the
caller the directory is not a checkout or the repo is elsewhere. For this case
both halves are false: the checkout is exactly where they said, and the same
commands work over sentinel_exec when that runs as the owner.

Reported by a user on /var/www, where the checkout belongs to the web account
and the agent runs as its own. stderr is what separates the two cases.
