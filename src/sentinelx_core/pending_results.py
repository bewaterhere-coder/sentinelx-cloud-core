"""Results that outlive the connection that was meant to carry them.

A background job's completion goes back over the very websocket the request
arrived on. If that socket is gone by the time the work finishes -- our own
deployment, the operator's network, anything -- the send fails and the result is
simply lost. The agent did the work, built the answer, and wrote it to a
connection nobody was reading.

Three users reported the same shape of loss in one day, and 98 job records were
sitting at "running" fleet-wide with nothing ever coming back for them.

So: write the event down before attempting to send it, delete it once the send
succeeds, and replay whatever is still on disk the next time we connect. The hub
accepts a completion from any connection belonging to the same user, and
applying one twice yields the same record, so a replay is safe.

Deliberately NOT a job registry. The work still runs inside the agent process
and still dies with it -- what survives here is the ANSWER, not the job. That is
the failure everyone actually hit; surviving an agent restart is a separate and
much larger change.
