"""script_run handler: execute a temporary bash/python script with optional sudo.

Ported from legacy SentinelX 0.3.5 /script/run endpoint. Writes the script
content to a workdir under the upload base, executes it, returns stdout/stderr/
returncode. Cleans up unless cleanup=False is requested (in which case the
caller gets the path back, useful for debugging).

Security model:
- The script is written to a per-request workdir (no name collisions).
- Optional `sudo` requires that the agent user is in sudoers without password
  for the relevant binary. We don't try to validate that here.
- timeout is hard-capped at 600 seconds (10 min); longer work should run
  in the background and be polled rather than blocking the caller.
- The script's content itself is NOT validated against the policy allowlist
  — the allowlist applies to `exec` only. `script_run` is a separate
  capability with its own scope, intentionally more powerful.

Text integrity on Windows (issue #28)
=====================================

Unicode must survive `script_run` without the caller adding boilerplate,
and Windows breaks that in three places, each handled at its own boundary:

  - Python inherits the console's legacy code page for stdio and raises
    UnicodeEncodeError on ordinary accented text -> PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
    is set for the child (setdefault: an explicit value still wins).
  - Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less .ps1 through the ANSI code
    page, mojibaking non-ASCII literals before the script runs -> .ps1
    files are written with a UTF-8 BOM on Windows.
  - the same shell encodes REDIRECTED output in the console code page,
    destroying anything outside it before we ever see the bytes -> the
    user's script runs through a UTF-8 bootstrap (see
    _POWERSHELL_BOOTSTRAP), in a child console of its own.

As a safety net, captured bytes are decoded as UTF-8 first and fall back
to the host's code page only when that fails, which covers children that
still emit legacy bytes (a caller who pins a legacy PYTHONIOENCODING, a
bash port, pwsh on an exotic host).

Argv, exit-code semantics, the user's script text and the workstation's
console code page are all left exactly as they were — each verified on a
real Windows PowerShell 5.1 host.

# code page, and without this flag that lands on the console the agent
# itself inherits — leaking 65001 into every later child. With it, the
# change dies with the child and the agent's console keeps its own code
# page. It also guarantees the child HAS a console, which is what makes
# the bootstrap work at all when the agent runs as a service.
#
# The flag itself now lives in sentinelx_core.winspawn, applied at every spawn
# site rather than only this one -- which is how seven others ended up without
# it and flashed windows on operators' desktops.

# Windows PowerShell 5.1 encodes redirected output in the console code page
# (cp437 on a default es/en install), so anything outside it is destroyed at
# the source: an em dash became "-" and a CJK character became "?" before
# the bytes ever reached us. No amount of decoding on our side brings those
# back, so the encoding has to be fixed IN the child (issue #28).
