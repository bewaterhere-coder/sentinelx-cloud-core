"""git_ops handler: structured Git operations (the `sentinel_git` tool).

ONE agent op ``git`` with an internal ``operation`` selector:

  - ``diff``        (read-only) : one bounded, structured view of a repo's
                                  current changes — replaces a chain of
                                  status / diff --stat / diff <file> exec calls.
  - ``apply_patch`` (rw mutation): apply one unified diff touching several
                                  files, all-or-nothing.

Why one op with an internal selector (not two agent ops)? It keeps the agent
surface small and mirrors how the hub presents compute/notifications as one
tool with an ``operation`` — adapted to the agent side.

GIT QUARANTINE (spec §0/§1): every git-specific concept lives in THIS module.
Nothing here bleeds into ``edit`` or the agnostic core primitives. A non-coding
operator sees one ``git`` tool they can ignore; ``edit`` stays pure.

Security substrate is copied verbatim from ``project_snapshot.py`` (the
canonical template): a fixed ``_GIT_ENV``, a fixed-argv ``_run_git`` that never
uses a shell, per-command and total timeouts, and — critically — the git-root
REVALIDATION against the file_ops allowlist. Path validation reuses
``fileops`` (``_resolve_or_reject`` for the read op) and, for the mutation,
``policy.resolve_path(path, need_write=True)`` exactly like ``edit``/``fsmutate``.
