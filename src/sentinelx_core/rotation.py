"""Agent-side credential rotation (phase 2).

Every host's session credential expires 365 days after it was issued and
nothing renewed it, so the whole fleet would age out (Aug-Sep 2027 for most).
This rotates the credential past its half-life, which also lets the hub revoke
a stolen copy at the next rotation.

The one rule that governs every choice here: a rotation that goes wrong must
NEVER leave a host unable to connect.

  - The rotated credential is written to a SEPARATE file
    (identity.rotated.json) in a directory the agent owns. identity.json --
    root-owned, the original enrolment credential -- is never touched.
  - On startup the agent prefers the rotated file IF it is present and valid,
    and otherwise falls back to identity.json, which is still a valid
    credential. A corrupt or half-written rotated file simply means "use the
    original".
  - The write is atomic: temp file in the same dir, fsync, os.replace. A crash
    mid-write leaves either the old rotated file or none -- never a truncated one.
  - If no writable directory exists, rotation is disabled with a warning and
    the host keeps running on its current credential (covered by the hub's
    legacy grace). Never worse than today.
